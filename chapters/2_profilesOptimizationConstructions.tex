\section{Frame design choices}

\subsection{Support frames}
The frames are devided up into smaller phases and tags, to keep the drawings and calculations from being cluttered or confusing.\\
The support frames are generally constructed from HEA200, S235. In situations where a different profile is needed to support the loads or deal with space limitations, profiles can be chosen from HEA140 up to HEB300.\\
The wind bracings are made out of angles, 60x60x6 up to 120x120x12, in steps of 20mm.\\
The corner bracings are made out of IPE120 or IPE160, sometimes HEA profiles are chosen when necessary.\\

\subsection{Single Supports}
The columns are usually made out of UNP180.\\
The bracings are made out of flat 60x10 and angle 60x60x6.\\
There are extra angles 70x70x7 connected between the support and the conveyor, to provide stability during installment.\\
If a support is too heavily loaded, the choice can be made to construct the support from HEA.\\

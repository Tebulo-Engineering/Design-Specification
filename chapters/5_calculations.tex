\section{Calculations}
The entire steel construction including the baseplates is calculated according to \norm .\\
To determine if a seismic calculation has to be done for this project, \norm\ will be consulted. The Seismic Design Category is \EqClass , as is determined by \norm .
\begin{itemize}

\item	Since the conveyors are Bollegraaf's design, the connections, stiffness and deformation of said conveyors is not calculated or considered in the design.
\item	Since the platforms are provided by Bollegraaf, they are not calculated, weights and loads due to the platforms however, are taken into account.
\item	The structural integrity of the concrete floor due to the steel support construction is not calculated.
\item	The act of connecting additional structure or equipment to the structures provided in this report will require a new calculation, and invalidates the results from this report.
\item	If the construction is realised differently from the design of Tebulo, no guarantees can be given about the integrity of the structure.
\item	As long as there are still unreleased items in the project, all given reaction forces, floor loads or other are preliminary, and no conclusions should be drawn from these values.
\end{itemize}
